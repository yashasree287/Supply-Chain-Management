# Supply Chain Management Dashboard

# Overview

The Supply Chain Management Dashboard provides actionable insights into various aspects of supply chain operations, including product sales, stock levels, shipping efficiency, manufacturing lead times, and inspection results. This project aims to help businesses optimize their supply chain processes and improve decision-making using data visualization and analysis.

# Features of the Dashboard

Revenue Analysis: Understand revenue generated by product types and suppliers.

Stock Monitoring: Track stock levels across SKUs and product types.

Inspection Results: Analyze inspection outcomes and costs associated with Passed, Failed, and Pending results.

Shipping Efficiency: Visualize shipping costs by carrier and location, and evaluate shipping times.

Manufacturing Analysis: Examine production volumes and lead times to identify bottlenecks in manufacturing processes.

Customer Demographics: View revenue contributions by customer demographics, such as gender.

Defect Rates: Understand defect rates by supplier and location.

# Key Visualizations

Revenue Analysis:Bar chart visualizing revenue generated by each product type and supplier.Filters available for product type and supplier name.

Stock Levels Heat Map:Heat map showing stock levels across different SKUs and product types.

Inspection Costs Breakdown:Pie chart illustrating costs incurred for Passed, Failed, and Pending inspection results.Filters for shipping carrier and location.

Shipping Costs by Carrier:Bar chart showcasing shipping costs per carrier.

Manufacturing Efficiency:Dual-axis chart comparing production volumes and manufacturing lead times.

Customer Demographics:Tree map representing revenue distribution across gender demographics.

# How to Use

# Dataset Preparation:

Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and formatted correctly.

Missing or invalid data should be handled before analysis.

# Interactive Dashboards:

Use filters and parameters to explore specific areas of interest (e.g., location, product type).

Hover over visualizations for tooltips with detailed insights.

# Actionable Insights:

Identify trends, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement across the supply chain.

# Goals and Insights
The dashboard is designed to:

Optimize supply chain processes by analyzing trends and identifying bottlenecks.

Provide a clear understanding of revenue generation, inventory management, and shipping efficiency.

Highlight key areas of improvement, such as inspection failures or high shipping costs.

# Future Improvements

Add predictive analytics for demand forecasting.

Integrate real-time data updates for dynamic dashboards.

Include supply chain risk assessment metrics.
